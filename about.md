Welcome to Social Mining. I'm going to use this blog as a brain dump for my research into Text Mining for the Social Sciences. In general, I will be interested in themes such as Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, theories of social structure and social communication etc.

This blog is intended primarily for my own use so don't expect an expert level of analysis: I will be writing about subjects as I learn them in order to help me learn them and the level will reflect this.

If you're still here after that disclaimer please feel free to wander around. Any questions or comments can be directed at my email address.
