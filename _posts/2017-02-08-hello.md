Welcome to my blog. I've started this site to log my exploration of the field of Text Mining as it can be applied to Social Sciences. I'm glad you're here, but please bear in mind that it's not meant for professional consumption at this stage. I'm still very much an amateur within the field and the level here will reflect this. For more information, see the [about page](/about).
