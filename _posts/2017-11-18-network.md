I've been messing around recently with network visualisations using [Gephi](https://gephi.org) and I wanted to look at an interesting dataset. To that end I pulled down some of the data from [Magtelite.dk](http://www.magtelite.dk) which is based on a PhD done by Christopher Ellersgaard and Anton Grau Larsen.

I have mangled the data and exported it into a javascript visualisation [which you can see here](/elite/).

[![elite-visualisation](/images/elite.png)](/elite/)

While the online tool is really high quality, I think the visualisation could be improved in a couple of ways. One issue is that there is no real sense of communities within the network. It's possible to do this in Gephi and I might try to do this in another iteration. Another issue is that the graph is dominated by a few organisations with very many members. It gives a sense of their scale, but it might be misleading, in that some board with 30 members could easily be less important than another with only 5 members. Another approach could be to cut out the organisations altogether flattening them into direct connections between people.

## Technical details

I found the data on [Larsen's GitHub page](https://github.com/antongrau/soc.elite) as R datafiles. I exported it to CSV format, wrote a quick Ruby script to convert it into nodes and edges before importing into Gephi. It wasn't entirely obvious to me what the best data to use was, so I ended up combining the person and affiliation data from the `pe13` and `den` files. I excluded all nodes with less than two connections to make the dataset more manageable. Once imported into Gephi, I used Fruchterman Rheingold and ForceAtlas 2 to group and space the data, before adding colouring and scaling based on Node category and Node degree respectively. I then exported the data to a HTML / Javascript document using the SigmaJS plugin. Note that this workflow comes from [Martin Grandjean's Gephi Tutorial](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/gephi-introduction/).

I think the data here is from 2013, as that was the data available on the GitHub. They have apparently updated the data since then, but I couldn't find the new data.


For reference, here is the content of my Ruby conversion script.

```ruby

require 'csv'
require 'set'

nodes = CSV.open('trimmed_nodes.csv', 'wb')
edges_f = CSV.open('trimmed_edges.csv', 'wb')

nodes << [ 'ID', 'Label', 'Category' ]
edges_f << ['Source', 'Target', 'Type', 'Label']

persons = Set.new
orgs = Set.new
person_counts = {}
edges = []

CSV.foreach('pe13.csv') do |row|
  person = row[1]
  label = row[2]
  org = row[4]
  sec_org = row[6]
  persons << person
  person_counts[person] = (person_counts[person] || 0) + 1
  edges << [person, org, 'Undirected', label] unless org == 'NA'
end

CSV.foreach('den.csv') do |row|
  person = row[1]
  label = person
  org = row[2]
  role = row[3]
  source = row[6]
  next if source == 'Events'
  persons << person
  person_counts[person] = (person_counts[person] || 0) + 1
  edges << [person, org, 'Undirected', role]
end
persons.each do |p|
  nodes << [ p, p, 'Person' ] if person_counts[p] > 1
end
edges.each do |e|
  if person_counts[e[0]] > 1
    edges_f << e
    orgs << e[1]
  end
end

orgs.each {|o| nodes << [o, o, 'Organisation'] }
nodes.close
edges_f.close
```
